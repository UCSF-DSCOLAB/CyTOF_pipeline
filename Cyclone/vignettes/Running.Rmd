# Introduction

This pipeline ...

## Starting point

To get started with this pipeline, you should have:
- A folder containing fcs files from cytof data
- sample metadata
- marker metadata
- tsv(/csv?) of grid sizes

## What this pipeline does do

- Chunks work of the steps below accross 8 'checkpoints'
- Calculates UMAP embeddings
- Performs clustering with FlowSOM (first, over an optimization space to allow users to pick their ideal parameters. Then, with user-chosen parameters)
- Calculates and outputs various metrics:
  - Per cluster: median expression of all markers
  - ... 

## What this pipeline does NOT do

The pipeline assumes you have already performed any of the below pre-processing steps which would have been necessary for your data:
- debarcoding
- bead normalization
- batch correction

OPTIONALLY, if your data has been batch corrected by a method that does not output corrected fcs files, and only outputs a corrected matrix...

## Setup

To run the pipeline, you first need to:

- Install all required packages
- Choose or create an intended output directory
- Create a set of metadata files:
  - sample_metadata
  - file_metadata
  - marker_metadata
- Finalize your config.yml file.

### Installing FlosSOM and other dependencies

Simply installing this <package-name> counterpart will take care of most required installations.
You can install from github with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) {
    install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("ravipatel4/CyTOF_pipeline", subdir = "dscoSOM")
```

Some packages are not absolutely required, so we leave to the user whether to install them.
If you want them, you will need to install them yourself:

- Scaffold

### Config.yml File

The file directs the pipeline to find all inputs, and is the main point of control for how the pipeline will be run.

How to create:
fill in the config.yml file, saving it with whatever name you would like.
We will use "my_config.yml".

#### Notes on Parallelization

## Running the Pipeline

Once everything is set up:

1. Run the pipeline and put it to your config.yml.

```
Rscript cytof_pipeline.R config.yml
```

### Checkpoints

The pipeline is broken down into multiple chunks, where each chunk saves its output as a checkpoint.Rdata file.







# Other things we'll want to hit on

Parallelization
Processing requirements (per checkpoint?)
Afterwards... maybe a second vignette for visualization and exploration of the outputs!
